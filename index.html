<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
  I usually like to draw or play games while listening to a show or twitch stream. I also really like to watch anime but I can't really do anything while watching it so I enjoy it a few hours before bed. I am also an avid reader and I have a decently large library in my room filled with books I've read.

<h3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Least Favorite Subject</h3>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
  I like pretty much all the school subjects, however, this school has 4 floors and when our locker is on the third or fourth floor, gym is a pain. I didn't take it this year but I did last year and had math afterwards. It was not a great experience for me to say the least, especially sice I have no interests in sports.
